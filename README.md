# DAT5092-Final-Project 

## Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between insecure employment and income levels below the London Living Wage (LLW) from 2015 to 2022. It aims to uncover patterns and correlations that can inform socio-economic policies and strategies in London.

## Installation

 ## Data
The analysis is based on data from:
- `earnings1.xlsx`
- `full_earnings_data.xlsx`
- `InsecureWork.xlsx`

## Testing

python -m unittest discover 

## CI/CD
